# maven-assignment
This is a small java project using Maven, created mostly for training purposes.

This assignment includes two parts:

1. The class ArrayStats, which is able to provide the mean, median, max and min value over
an array of integer values. Also, this class can provide the same statistical measurements
for an array list of Integer values.

1.1 Assumptions:

    If the input array or arraylist are empty, no error will be thrown, but:
        -   Methods max() and min() will return 0
        -   Methods mean() and median() will return Double.NaN
